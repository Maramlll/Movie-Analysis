In this project we'll be analyzing data associated with movies. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database(TMDb). Including user ratings and revenue. Since there is no further information, we assume that 'budget' and 'revenue' are in US dollars, and the dataset show the global revenues. Since we are comparing movies spanning from the 1960s up to 2015, we use the inflation-adjusted columns 'budget_adj' and 'revenue_adj'. Questions which will need to be answered are:
Does runtime affect the vote average the people give for the movie?
Are the number of the movie increase each year?
Dose the revenues of the movie field increase each year?
